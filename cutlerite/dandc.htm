    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On
    September 24, 1831, at a General Assembly held at Kirtland, Ohio, a committee of four was
    appointed to arrange the items of doctrine of Jesus Christ for the government of his
    church for the book to be published as the first edition of the <a href="referenc.htm"> Doctrine and Covenants
    </a> of
    the church.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This
    committee was given almost four years to complete their work, as the general assembly met
    on August 17, 1835 to accept or reject their work. Each one of the quorums when voting
    their approval declared it as being, &quot;the doctrine and covenants of their
    faith&quot;, each quorum voted separately and at the end they accepted the book by a
    unanimous vote. (Doctrine and Covenants, section 108a, RLDS).</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    original committee consisted of Joseph Smith Jr., Sidney Rigdon, Oliver Cowdery, and
    Frederick G. Williams. The book contained a preface, the Lectures on Faith, the
    revelations which had been selected, the marriage covenant, and an article on
    &quot;governments and laws in General&quot;. To show the importance they placed in the
    Lectures on Faith, they were printed in the front of the book following the preface.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lectures were printed in each Doctrine and Covenants until
    1897, when one of the major factions of the restoration churches declared them no longer
    essential as a part of scripture. The other major faction printed them until 1921 and then
    removed them from their book. Today the lectures are looked upon by both churches as being
    only of historical value. Seventy four pages were removed from the book which was
    published in the beginning with two hundred fifty seven pages. The lectures teach us step
    by step what is required of us in order to gain our salvation, and also what salvation is.
    This committee who compiled the Doctrine and Covenants was instructed to take items from
    the Bible and the Book of Mormon; this is what the lectures are made up of, scriptural
    references.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joseph
    explains that only the sacrifice of all earthly things will prepare people for the faith
    necessary to obtain eternal life. The plan set forth in these lectures applies to all
    mankind and none are exempt. It is only through living to these requirements that men have
    gained this power to perform in the gifts that are promised to the church.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both copies
    of the Doctrine and Covenants printed by the two major restoration churches contain the
    same revelations received by the prophet until his death in 1844. The 1844, 1845 and
    <a href="referene.htm"> 1846
    Doctrine and Covenants </a> are the same. The 1846 edition is used by the Cutlerites with
    lectures in the front of the book where they belong. The revelations up to
      1835 have be verified against the original manuscript.&nbsp; The
      additional seven revelations given to Joseph Smith Jr. from 1835 to 1844
      are included in the 1846 Doctrine and Covenants, and are accepted and used
      as doctrine by the church.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joseph
    Smith received many revelations to direct the church in its doctrine and operations. The
    church realized the need of combining these instructions into a book that would not only
    preserve this information, but would make it possible to distribute it as a means of
    forwarding the gospel to all people.</font></p>
