    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ordinance of baptism
    for the dead was performed in Paul's Day. In writing his first epistle to the Corinthians,
    talking about the resurrection and trying to show those people that there was to be a
    resurrection for all mankind, he asked them the question, &quot;Else what shall they do
    which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? Why are they then baptized
    for the dead?&quot;. (I Corinthians 15:29, Inspired Version.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When God gave the
    commandment in 1841 that the Nauvoo temple was to be built, he also granted a sufficient
    length of time for the accomplishment of this work.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But, behold, at
    the end of this appointment, your baptisms for your dead shall not be acceptable unto me;
    and if you do not these things at the end of the appointment, ye shall be rejected as a
    church with your dead, saith the Lord your God.&quot; (Doctrine and Covenants, section
    107,verse 11a, RLDS)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The temple was to be
    similar to the temple in Kirtland, Ohio, though larger in dimension, and provision was to
    be made for a baptismal font where the lately revealed ordinance of the baptism for the
    dead could be performed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the appointed time
    expired the temple still lacked much of being finished, ready for dedication to the Lord,
    so the rejection promised by the Lord became a fact.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The confusion between
    the Restoration churches exists today because most of the churches do not believe of this
    rejection, but chose their own leader and continued on with the original church after
    collecting as many as possible of the historical records of the church, journals of the
    elders, minutes of the conferences and council meetings etc.&nbsp; Soon they were busily
    engaged in changing, revising and editing all that came into their hands. In many cases
    the records were deliberately altered to conform to new doctrines and practices not taught
    in the church before, while others were suppressed or destroyed. When the church was
    dissolved due to transgression, the authority or priesthood rights were preserved in the
    Kingdom Order.</font></p>
