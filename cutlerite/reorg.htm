    Reorganization Of The Church Of Jesus Christ</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Fisher&#146;s Grove<br>
    Fremont County, Iowa<br>
    September 19, 1853</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The people of Fisher&#146;s Grove assembled at
    the house of Brother Edmund Fisher, and after some instruction from (Father) Alpheus
    Cutler proceeded to reorganize The Church Of Jesus Christ as far as circumstances and
    wisdom would dictate, as the Church that was organized by the Prophet Joseph Smith had
    through transgression become a rejected people as pertaining to the Church. It therefore
    became necessary that something should be done or that the door should be opened, as God
    always provides a way that the honest in heart may have a chance for salvation. In this
    case he left means whereby the Church and Kingdom might again be reorganized in it&#146;s
    purity, that the sinner might repent and (being willing to follow the example set by our
    Savior) go forward and be baptized for a remission of their sins, making a covenant at the
    water's edge to keep all the commandments of God that had been or might be given while we
    live, and taking Joseph Smith the Prophet of God, The Bible, The Book Of Mormon, The Book
    Of Doctrine and Covenants and the Constitution of these United States as a platform for
    our faith and doctrine. With this view they proceeded to reorganize the Church as follows:
    Firstly, Alpheus Cutler chosen as our &quot;head&quot; or &quot;chief councilor&quot; and
    sustained by a unanimous vote; Secondly, Brother Edmund Fisher chosen and sustained as
    President of The Church Of Jesus Christ by a clear vote; Thirdly, Chauncey Whiting chosen
    and sustained as Clerk of The Church Of Jesus Christ by a clear vote.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The meeting was then closed by prayer.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The preceding account was taken from the minutes
    of the meeting as recorded in the records of The Church Of Jesus Christ (Cutlerites).
