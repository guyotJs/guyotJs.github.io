    <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">As early as 1835 the Church of Jesus Christ had been accused of
      practicing polygamy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A letter
      written by Joseph Smith while in jail in Liberty, Missouri on December 16,
      1838 explains the Church's views on the subject.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

      Christ</a>' on pages 252 and 253.</font>

    <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Hyram Smith's letter to a group of saints on China Creek, Hancock
      County, Illinois and published in the Times and Seasons, volume 5, page
      474, under the date of March 15, 1844 only a few months before his death,
      claimed it was never a part of the restored gospel.</font>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>An eminent jurist, Federal Judge John F. Phillips, reviewed the
      evidence presented by the Utah Mormon Church in legal proceedings wherein
      the origin of the doctrine and practice of polygamy was a vital issue, and
      he held that Brigham Young, and not Joseph Smith, was the author and
      instigator of that obnoxious and heretical doctrine.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>The first edition of the <a href="referene.htm"> Doctrine and Covenants</a> in which section
      132 appears is 1876, printed by the Deseret News, Salt Lake City,
      Utah'32 years after the prophet's death.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The Cutlerite Church owns a Doctrine and Covenants printed by the
      Utah Church in 1851, and it did not contain section 132.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The practice of polygamy has been prevalent since the dawn of time, but
      has always been condemned by God as being a sin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>His feelings on the matter are very plainly shown in all three of
      the books we use as scripture.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Following
      are just a few of the many references in which this is proven:</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      In the Bible, it tells us in Genesis, chapter 2, verse 30, how
      marriage was initiated in the very beginning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>'Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall
      cleave unto his wife;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>and
      they shall be one flesh.'<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
      concept is reiterated and more thoroughly described in Mark, chapter 10,
      verses 6 through 10.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      In First Corinthians,
      chapter 7, verses 2 and 3, it says:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>'Nevertheless,
      I say, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let
      every woman have her own husband.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Let
      the husband render unto the wife due benevolence;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>and likewise also the wife unto the husband.'</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      In Ephesians, chapter 5,
      verses 31 through 33, it says:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>'For
      this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined
      unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>This is a great mystery;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>but
      I speak concerning Christ and the Church.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Nevertheless, let every one of you in particular so love his wife
      even as himself;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>and the wife
      see that she reverence her husband.'<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Please note that it says 'they two', not three, four or more.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">In the Book Of Mormon, I
      quote from the writings of Jacob, chapter 1, verse 15:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>'And now it came to pass that the people of Nephi, under the
      reign of the second king, began to grow hard in their hearts, and indulge
      themselves somewhat in wicked practices, such as like unto David of
      old, desiring many wives and concubines, and also Solomon, his son.'</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      In Jacob, chapter 2, verses
      31 through 33, it says 'But the word of God burthens me because of your
      grosser crimes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For behold,
      thus saith the Lord, this people begin to wax in iniquity;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>they understand not the scriptures:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>for they seek to excuse themselves in committing whoredoms, because
      of the things which were written concerning David, and Solomon his son.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Behold, David and Solomon truly had many wives, and concubines, which
      thing was abominable before me, saith the Lord.'</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      In verses 36 and 37 it says
      'Wherefore, my brethren, hear me, and hearken to the word of the Lord:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>For there shall not any man among you have save it be one wife;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>and concubines he shall have none:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>For I, the Lord God, delighteth in the chastity of women.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>And whoredoms are an abomination before me:<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>thus saith the Lord of hosts.'</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      In the Doctrine and
      Covenants (1846 edition) I quote from section 13, verse 7:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>'Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shall cleave
      unto her and none else;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>and
      he that looketh upon a woman to lust after her, shall deny the faith, and
      shall not have the spirit, and if he repents not he shall be cast out.'</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      In section 35, verse 3, we
      read 'And again I say unto you, that whoso forbiddeth to marry, is not
      ordained of God, for marriage is ordained of God unto man:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>wherefore it is lawful that he should have one wife, and
      they twain shall be one flesh, and all this that the earth might answer
      the end of it's creation;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>and
      that it might be filled with the measure of man, according to his creation
      before the world was made.'</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Section 109, known as the
      Marriage Covenant, was not a revelation, but was read at the General
      Assembly of the Church at Kirtland on August 17, 1835 where the acceptance
      and adoption of the first edition of the Doctrine and Covenants was voted
      on and acknowledged by a unanimous vote.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>This article was also read, voted on and acknowledged by a
      unanimous vote and was ordered to be printed in the book.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>It is a clear affirmation of the laws of the Church concerning the
      sacrament of marriage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You
      will notice that polygamy is condemned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>I quote from verse 4:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>'Inasmuch
      as this Church of Christ has been reproached with the crime of
      fornication, and polygamy:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>we
      declare that we believe, that one man should have one wife;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>and one woman, but one husband, except in case of death when either
      is at liberty to marry again.'</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      There is an excellent
      chapter on polygamy in the book 'Alpheus Cutler and the Church of Jesus
      Christ' by Rupert and Daisy Fletcher, which fully explains the
      Church's belief and feelings on the subject.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>This chapter begins on page 247 and ends on page 258 of said book,
      and contains many fine references for the reader.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">There is also proof of
      Cutler's stand on the subject in the book 'Joseph Smith Fought
      Polygamy' by Richard and Pamela Price (See pages 203-204).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>This is an excellent book, and is a must for anyone who is
      seriously researching the subject.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
      is well written, and is completely backed up by references throughout.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">We believe that we serve an
      unchangeable God, as described in the third lecture of the 'Lectures On
      Faith', which were published and placed in the front of the first
      several editions of the Doctrine and Covenants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>These lectures were also voted on and accepted by a unanimous vote
      at the General Assembly previously mentioned, and were deemed judiciously
      arranged, compiled and profitable for doctrine.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">I quote from the third
      lecture, (1846 Doctrine and Covenants, page 44, verses 15 and 16) which is
      describing the character of God:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>'Thirdly,
      That he changes not, neither is there variableness with him;<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>but that he is the same from everlasting to everlasting,
      being the same yesterday, today and forever;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>and that his course is one eternal round, without variation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Fourthly, That he is a God of truth and cannot lie.'</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      If this is the case, then
      how can we accept a doctrine that teaches us that God can 'change the
      rules' from time to time according to his will?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>If we are to believe that God truly cannot lie, and we say we
      accept the scriptures as gospel, then we have to accept the fact that
      anyone who defends the concept of plural marriage must surely be in error.</font><font size="3"><o:p>
