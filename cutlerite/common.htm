    face="Times New Roman" size="4">This principle seems to be accepted or believed in by
    quite a few of the believers in the Restoration movement, but for various reasons not
    practiced.&nbsp; It seems to be a condition or a way of life that can be achieved only by
    a people with a sufficient portion of the Lord's Holy Spirit to enable them to work
    together in love and union.&nbsp;&nbsp; A people with only the natural mind of man to
    guide them will never be able to achieve this state.&nbsp; This principle calls for a
    people who will give unto their God their all, believing they are called to do so.&nbsp;
    The Lord has said in various places and at various times, that &quot;if you are not one
    you are not mine&quot;.&nbsp; If this is true, then man with only the natural mind cannot
    be one, and will fail to attain this goal.&nbsp; A sacrifice of all earthly things is
    required, and as the Lectures on Faith brings out, &quot;any religion that does not
    require man to come to these principles will never give man the power to gain the faith
    necessary to lay hold upon eternal life. &nbsp; They also teach we cannot expect to gain
    our salvation in the Eternal World and associate with the former saints who gave their all
    and gained their salvation unless we, in like manner, make the same offerings and
    sacrifices.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Believing God is
    unchangeable, a just and a righteous God, could we have full faith in him were He to allow
    one privileges above another?&nbsp; We are taught He is no respecter of persons but He is
    of conduct.&nbsp; In all ages of the world when there has been a great outpouring of the
    Spirit, what has it led people to?&nbsp; God and all His Holy Prophets have always taught
    the principles of Equality.&nbsp; How does a man achieve this Equality?&nbsp; Does he do
    it by giving a tenth of what he earns?&nbsp; Will that produce a condition where one man
    has no possessions above another?&nbsp; Will it lead to men working together in love and
    union?&nbsp; It seems that man has always been reluctant to&nbsp; accept the principles
    taught in the Holy Scriptures.&nbsp;&nbsp; Often they think they have a better plan
    than
    the Lord's,&nbsp; but following their plans they always fail.&nbsp; First, it takes a
    certain portion of the Lord's Spirit to create in man the desire for that condition, and
    then additional Spirit to meet the obstacles met in reaching that goal.&nbsp; When
    sufficient Spirit is secured to do this, then what does it lead men to do?&nbsp; It leads
    them to work in love and union,&nbsp; and as stated in the Book of Mormon regarding the
    200 years they lived to this, there were no happier people on the face of the earth.
    &nbsp; </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lord created man and
    put him here on earth with the need of food, clothing, and these material things, and He
    has said that there is enough given for all, were it (is) used as He intended. &nbsp;
    Whenever man has met these conditions and made these sacrifices,&nbsp; inevitably the
    blessings of Heaven are granted and man has received far more than he ever could following
    his own natural desires.&nbsp; The principle of all things common, if adhered to, will
    give unto man the things the Lord would want him to have, and will achieve a condition
    such as Enoch's people who became so righteous they were taken from the earth as the world
    was not worthy of them.&nbsp; The Lord cares nothing for these material things; &nbsp; He
    simply wants the testimony of man that man puts God ahead;&nbsp; thus when He required
    these blood offerings etc., He wanted the firstlings of their flocks, not the culls they
    were going to throw out anyway.&nbsp; Can we quarrel with this principle? &nbsp; Can we
    truly say that this is not the best way to go?&nbsp; Then if we believe in it, why don't
    we keep it?&nbsp; Why not make every effort to live to it and receive the attendant
    blessings?&nbsp; Wouldn't it be worth the sacrifice to enjoy these blessings, and then
    when we go before our maker for our final judgment,&nbsp; have Him say, &quot;Enter into
    my rest at the right hand of the Father&quot;?&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
