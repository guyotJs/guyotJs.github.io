    <p align="center"><font face="Rockwell" size="4">About Zion</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is to
    tell you about an experience that came to me in the early 1950's. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was on a
    Sunday morning when the Spirit came to me and it stayed with me all day.&nbsp; I had been
    visited by the Spirit many times before, but at this time I was given a look into the
    future of Zion.&nbsp; It was not like an audible voice speaking, but as we are told when
    we are confirmed a member in the church, &quot;a still small voice&quot;.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our people
    had been told by a former leader in the church, that when we received a revelation from
    God, it would cite us back to the written word, or the scriptures.&nbsp; There were many
    scriptures brought to my mind to confirm the message as being authentic.&nbsp; There were
    too many references given to relate them all but I will try to write some of them, &nbsp;
    hoping it will be of interest to many believers in the Restoration.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had
    prayed much in times past to know how Zion would be brought about, for I saw all around me
    the disunion among the believers in the Restoration Movement.&nbsp; Now this was the exact
    opposite of the ionic plan held forth in the scriptures, for the plan to build Zion is
    based on complete unity among its members.&nbsp; For it is written, &quot;If you are not
    one, you are not mine&quot;.&nbsp; How could this be brought about?&nbsp; I had never
    doubted from the very first that such a plan would be put into effect for the scriptures
    plainly tell us that God has had people on this earth in former days who, through the
    outpouring of His spirit were able to live above sin.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the
    requirement of God's law, that we come to the point of perfection, for Jesus said,
    &quot;Ye are therefore commanded to be prefect, even as your Father who is in Heaven is
    perfect&quot;.&nbsp; Nephi tell us in the Book of Mormon, that God never gives a
    commandment to the children of men, except He opens the way for it to be kept.&nbsp; This
    leaves men without excuse for disobeying the laws that would bring them to perfection.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But how are
    men to know what God's law really is amid all the confusion we find about us today? &nbsp;
    In the very beginning God gave His law through Adam,&nbsp; with the admonition that he
    teach it freely to his children.&nbsp; This same law given to Adam, brought about a Zion
    in Enoch's day, and Adam lived in the days of Enoch.&nbsp; One only needs to read the
    story of Enoch and his followers to realize what a terrific change would take place were
    the same principles adhered to in our time.&nbsp; The laws of God as given to Moses would
    have had the same effect with the Children of Israel, had they lived them,&nbsp; but as a
    people they chose to become a law unto themselves, and after traveling for forty years,
    their carcasses fell in the wilderness.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These
    things should be an example to us; the obedience and the disobedience to the laws of God.
    &nbsp; Lehi and Nephi brought the laws of Moses with them from Jerusalem.&nbsp; They were
    written on the plates of brass, and it was under these laws that the Nephites lived until
    Christ appeared to them on this land after His resurrection.&nbsp; It is evident that by
    living to the principles set forth in this law, the Nephites were able to prepare
    themselves to stand in the very presence of their risen Saviour.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are told that
    only the more righteous of the Nephites were spared from destruction during the great
    three day storm that swept the wicked from the face of this land at the time of the
    crucifixion of Christ.&nbsp; While He was with them, Christ expounded all their scriptures
    and through their keeping of these laws, a Zion was enjoyed for many years, and not one
    soul was lost.&nbsp; The meaning of the word &quot;restoration&quot; is to have a Zion
    again upon the earth as in former days.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, the
    things that were shown me while in the spirit on that Sunday morning was, that God would
    work along that same plan in starting this last part of His work, as He did in Joseph
    Smith's day when He revealed to him where the plates were hidden.&nbsp; When Joseph
    received the gold plates from the hands of the angel, he was instructed to translate only
    that part of the plates which were not sealed.&nbsp; Now the mere fact that those gold
    plates had come into Joseph's possession was not enough to establish him as a prophet and
    seer in the eyes of others, so for this reason God required that other men be called as
    witnesses of the truth of Joseph's claims, regarding the gold plates.&nbsp; Because of
    these instructions we find the testimony of the eleven witnesses printed in the front of
    every Book of Mormon that has ever been published.&nbsp; Three of these men saw the angel
    come down from Heaven and lay the plates before them.&nbsp; The other eight witnesses saw
    only the plates, but they were all commanded to bear witness to the whole world, to the
    truth of what they had been privileged to behold.&nbsp; It is a matter of record that not
    one of these witnesses ever denied their testimony during their lifetime.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This same
    plan will be used when God sees fit, in His wisdom, to raise up another seer and bring
    forth the sealed portion of the gold plates which have been kept back because of the
    wickedness of the people.&nbsp; Joseph Smith was told, &quot;Touch not the things which
    are sealed, for I will bring them forth in my own due time: for I will shew unto the
    children of men, that I am able to do mine own work.&nbsp; Wherefore, when thou hast read
    the words which I have commanded thee, and have obtained the witnesses which I have
    promised unto thee, then shalt thou seal up the book again, and hide it up unto me, that I
    may preserve the works which thou hast not read until I shall see fit in mine own wisdom,
    to reveal all things unto the children of men&quot;. Page 151, RLDS edition and page 97,
    LDS edition of the Book of Mormon.&nbsp; And again &quot;For the book shall be sealed by
    the power of God, and the revelation which was sealed, shall be kept in the book until the
    own due time of the Lord, that they may come forth: for, behold, they reveal all things
    from the foundation of the world unto the end thereof.&nbsp; And the day cometh that the
    words of the book which were sealed, shall be read upon the housetops, and they shall be
    read by the power of Christ; And all things shall be revealed unto the children of men
    which ever have been among the children of men, and which ever will be, even unto the end
    of the earth&quot;.&nbsp; Page 149, RLDS edition, page 96, LDS edition, Book of Mormon.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This will
    be the work of the second seer, when he becomes qualified in the eyes of God, and proves
    by his works, that he is worthy to receive and translate that portion of the plates.
    &nbsp; The fact that he has the plates will be ample proof that he has the Melchisedec
    Priesthood handed down from Joseph Smith's day, for God will not work through any other
    channel than that which He has already established.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This
    prophet will also have the gift of revelation to instruct him in all things.&nbsp; He will
    call in men of good character from the other churches of the Restoration to bear witness
    to the truth of these claims, which will convert them, and they in turn will be
    instruments in the hands of God in bringing others to the knowledge of the truth through
    their testimony.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To build a
    Zion, God must overcome every obstacle that confronts mankind today.&nbsp; The plan which
    God gave Enoch, brought his people to perfection, and the same plan will establish Zion in
    the last days.&nbsp; The plan of equality will do away with poverty, the housing
    difficulties, and the racial differences.&nbsp; The honesty which will prevail among a
    converted people, will solve the greater part of our social and economic problems. &nbsp;
    These things cannot come to pass until the outpouring of the Holy Spirit is realized as it
    was in the days of Pentecost, as well as at the time of Christ's visit to this country.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God has
    said that it would come to pass in His own due time.&nbsp; Some are inclined to believe
    that man can bring about a Zion through keeping the commandments.&nbsp; This is true in
    part, but God's purposes will never be accomplished until He gives His followers a double
    portion of Spirit.&nbsp; This is a matter of record.&nbsp; Before this takes place we must
    all be born of the Spirit, not of many spirits, but of one, and through equal sacrifice we
    will receive an equal portion of spirit.&nbsp; Thus God will unite His church.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God's plan
    is based on time, and He is still on schedule.&nbsp; He raised up Joseph Smith at the
    appointed time, as He did all the former prophets, and He will make known the next prophet
    and seer at the proper time, for He knows who and where he is. &quot;For God's arm is not
    shortened, neither is His strength abated&quot;.</font></p>
