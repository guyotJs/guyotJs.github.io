Chapter 1
</h3>
<p class="shrunk">
<b><sup>1</sup></b> I Irkut, being divinely appointed by Kol, the one who is full of grace,
am writing this tablet to provide record of the history of my people.
<br/>
<b><sup>2</sup></b> The writing thereof in which holds the records of my people's ancestry and visions passed down through tongue.
<br/>
<b><sup>3</sup></b> 1 Irkut was born of my father Kakilithuit and mother Yensei who taught me in the tongue of our people and who passed down a great extent of my knowledge.
<br/>
<b><sup>4</sup></b> It came to pass that as I was hunting in a great cave there came upon me a figure whom I could not make out as when they appeared a tremendous light fell upon the place in which I stood.
<br/>
<b><sup>5</sup></b> And behold after my eyes had cleared themselves to the light I was able I make out the face of a man, and when my eyes lay upon him for but a glance I now knew I was in the presence of the almighty Kol
<br/>
<b><sup>6</sup></b> These words which Kol spake unto me I am unable to recite as it was not through the tongue of Kol in which he communicated nevertheless when I stood him I was overcame by his spirit who brought forth unto me a command in which I was to record all the records of my people lest they fall out of the favor of almighty Kol.
<br/>
<b><sup>7</sup></b> I shall bear this record as passed down through the tongues of my ancestors to preserve my people's history.
<br/>

Chapter 2
</h3>
<p class="shrunk">
<b><sup>1</sup></b> After the settling of the Chukoti people near the river called Kali a young man known as Kensil during the course of the night had a vision from which Kol and his son the exalted one appeared before him.
  <br/>
<b><sup>2</sup></b> And it came to pass that as Kensil slept Kol revealed unto him the creation of his new church in whom one god, the almighty Kol, shall be worshiped.
  <br/>
<b><sup>3</sup></b> Kol then revealed unto Kensil the sins and transgressions of his people and the ways in which he must preach to the people of Chukoti to turn their hearts to Kol.
  <br/>
<b><sup>4</sup></b> And soon after Kensil received all of this newfound wisdom he brought himself before his people and began to preach.
  <br/>
<b><sup>5</sup></b> And it came to pass that as he preached before the congregation some people joined Kensil who later joined the followers.
  <br/>
<b><sup>6</sup></b> Nevertheless there were some who did not believe and so persecuted Kensil and they who did so were struck by a holy which caused their eyes to be shut and their mouths to be closed.
  <br/>
<b><sup>7</sup></b> Many people then, saw that that which Kensil preacheth was true and so joined him.
  <br/>
<b><sup>8</sup></b> And it came to pass that Kensil appointed twelve leaders of the church whom he called the followers.
  <br/>
<b><sup>9</sup></b> This was how Kensil had heard from Kol and soon after that Kensil called all twelve to preach forth above all people.
  <br/>
<b><sup>10</sup></b> On the morning of the fourth day after Kensil began to preach he arose to a great blackness which encompassed the whole of his vision.
  <br/>
<b><sup>11</sup></b> And soon after, he heard a voice and he knew it was from the one who opposed Kol.
  <br/>
<b><sup>12</sup></b> And Kensil knew it was bad and so while encompassed in darkness Kensil prayed to Kol.
  <br/>
<b><sup>13</sup></b> And it came to pass that after he concluded his prayer there was a great light.
  <br/>
<b><sup>14</sup></b> And Kensil knew that the light was Kol and was exceedingly joyful. 
  <br/>
<b><sup>15</sup></b> And Kol spake unto Kensil once more saying "O Kensil my son, I give thee warning to listen not to the voice of my oppressor for it is he that bringeth death and draineth all my good from this world. 
  <br/>
<b><sup>16</sup></b> And Kensil understood what Kol spake unto him and so obeyed
  <br/>

Chapter 3
</h3>
<p class="shrunk">
  <b><sup>1</sup></b> It came to pass that after two years had passed Kensil fell exceedingly ill and was bedridden. 
  <br/>
   <b><sup>2</sup></b> And it came to pass that Kensil spake unto Kol in prayer and asked of him two things. 
  <br/>
   <b><sup>3</sup></b> Kensil first sought the reason for his illness for which Kol did not respond, then he asked whom shall he appoint as successor, to this Kol did respond.
  <br/>
   <b><sup>4</sup></b> And Kol spoke unto Kensil saying, "Thou shalt appoint Khor to be thy successor."
  <br/>
   <b><sup>5</sup></b> And Kensil looked upon Khor and saw that he was good.
  <br/>
   <b><sup>6</sup></b> Kensil then appointed Mekail to the twelve followers.
  <br/>
   <b><sup>7</sup></b> It came to pass that Kensil who suffereth much due to his illness became exceedingly weak and after but 5 months he was taken by his illness.
  <br/>
   <b><sup>8</sup></b> And thus the will of Kol was fulfilled.[a] 
  <br/>
   <b><sup>9</sup></b> And it was shown that the wisdom of Khor was exceedingly righteous and rich in wisdom.
  <br/>
   <b><sup>10</sup></b> Nevertheless soon into Khors ministry he saw a woman who was exceedingly beautiful and who captivated him.
  <br/>
   <b><sup>11</sup></b> And soon it came to pass that Khor looked into the woman and found her house and went to converse with her.
  <br/>
   <b><sup>12</sup></b> And Khor, after meeting with the woman, learned of her husband and so sought to slit his throat.
  <br/>
   <b><sup>13</sup></b> But nevertheless soon before attempting the life of the woman's husband he was overcome with a great power which was commanding of great respect.
  <br/>
   <b><sup>14</sup></b> As soon as the power set upon Khor he knew that which he had planned was sinful and against Kol and he sought to repent.
  <br/>
   <b><sup>15</sup></b> Kol after a little time forgave Khor through his grace and mercy and sought him to go and preach to the towns of Likta and Hockta which neighbored each other.
  <br/>
   <b><sup>16</sup></b> And it came to pass as Khor went and preached the people's hearts were opened and they joined Khor.
  <br/>
    <b><sup>17</sup></b> And it was shown that Khor became in good favor with Kol.
