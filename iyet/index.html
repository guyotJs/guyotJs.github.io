Chapter 1
</h3>
<p class="shrunk">
<b><sup>1</sup></b> I, Irkut, do write these things: a few words concerning the prophecies of our prophets, and also the genealogy of my forefathers.<br/>
<b><sup>2</sup></b> Now this history was hitherto unknown to our children who, being not raised following the faith of their fathers, have begun to walk in unbelief and wickedness.<br/>
<b><sup>3</sup></b> Now I was born of my mother Yensei and my father Kakilithuit, who walked in the way of righteousness all his days. And my mother also was a woman of great faith and stature.<br/>
<b><sup>4</sup></b> And it came to pass that, as I did lie awake beneath a larch tree, a visage of exceeding luster did fill mine eyes so that I perceived not the form thereof.<br/>
<b><sup>5</sup></b> Now, as my vision did return to me, I was overcome by the Lord; and he spake, saying: “I would that thou shouldst record the stories of thy kin, that it might be preserved for thy seed.”<br/>
<b><sup>6</sup></b> And I did begin to write according to the words which the Lord commanded, lest Zion be deprived from the love of her God.<br/>
<b><sup>7</sup></b> Now I, Irkut, did obey the commandment of the Lord, even as I did write concerning the prophets of my seed, and concerning the prophecies which were given unto them.<br/>
<b><sup>8</sup></b> And it came to pass that God did impart visions unto me, and also did he impart prophecies which had been lost, according to the records my people did keep.<br/>
<b><sup>9</sup></b> Now after a multitude of people did walk in the way of righteousness, they grew in wealth, and did obtain jewels, gold, and fine raiment in exceeding abundance.<br/>
<b><sup>10</sup></b> And it came to pass that, after they did obtain an abundance of wealth, they did mock the Lord, and did cry unto the people saying: “Wherefore have ye a God? Behold, is it not by our own hands that we have gathered this abundance?”<br/>
<b><sup>11</sup></b> Forasmuch as the people did mock the Lord, the Lord did deem necessary to send forth a prophet to declare his word among them.<br/>
<b><sup>12</sup></b> And it came to pass that as the people did mock the Lord, they did also blaspheme him insomuch that they did persecute those who did believe on His word.<br/>
<b><sup>13</sup></b> Behold, the Lord hath prepared a way for them that believe; yea, He hath prepared the plan of salvation, that all might come unto Him.<br/>
<b><sup>14</sup></b> Yea, inasmuch as ye love the Lord your God, ye shall inherit your place in heaven.<br/>
<b><sup>15</sup></b> I, Irkan, write according to the words which the Lord spake concerning my people, notwithstanding the unbelief among the people thereof.<br/>
<b><sup>16</sup></b> And I do write this unto the convincing of my people, and that they may inherit eternal life.<br/>
