Chapter 1
</h3>
<p class="shrunk">
<b><sup>1</sup></b> I Irkut, being divinely appointed by Kol, the one who is full of grace,
am writing this tablet to provide record of the history of my people.
<br/>
<b><sup>2</sup></b> The writing thereof in which holds the records of my people's ancestry and visions passed down through tongue.
<br/>
<b><sup>3</sup></b> 1 Irkut was born of my father Kakilithuit and mother Yensei who taught me in the tongue of our people and who passed down a great extent of my knowledge.
<br/>
<b><sup>4</sup></b> It came to pass that as I was hunting in a great cave there came upon me a figure whom I could not make out as when they appeared a tremendous light fell upon the place in which I stood.
<br/>
<b><sup>5</sup></b> And behold after my eyes had cleared themselves to the light I was able I make out the face of a man, and when my eyes lay upon him for but a glance I now knew I was in the presence of the almighty Kol
<br/>
<b><sup>6</sup></b> These words which Kol spake unto me I am unable to recite as it was not through the tongue of Kol in which he communicated nevertheless when I stood him I was overcame by his spirit who brought forth unto me a command in which I was to record all the records of my people lest they fall out of the favor of almighty Kol.
<br/>
<b><sup>7</sup></b> I shall bear this record as passed down through the tongues of my ancestors to preserve my people's history.
