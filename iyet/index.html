Chapter 1
</h3>
<p class="shrunk">
<b><sup>1</sup></b> I Irkut, being divinely appointed by Kol, the one who is full of grace,
am writing this tablet to provide record of the history of my people.
<br/>
<b><sup>2</sup></b> The writing thereof in which holds the records of my people's ancestry and visions passed down through tongue.
<br/>
<b><sup>3</sup></b> 1 Irkut was born of my father Kakilithuit and mother Yensei who taught me in the tongue of our people and who passed down a great extent of my knowledge.
<br/>
<b><sup>4</sup></b> It came to pass that as I was hunting in a great cave there came upon me a figure whom I could not make out as when they appeared a tremendous light fell upon the place in which I stood.
<br/>
<b><sup>5</sup></b> And behold after my eyes had cleared themselves to the light I was able I make out the face of a man, and when my eyes lay upon him for but a glance I now knew I was in the presence of the almighty Kol
<br/>
<b><sup>6</sup></b> These words which Kol spake unto me I am unable to recite as it was not through the tongue of Kol in which he communicated nevertheless when I stood him I was overcame by his spirit who brought forth unto me a command in which I was to record all the records of my people lest they fall out of the favor of almighty Kol.
<br/>
<b><sup>7</sup></b> I shall bear this record as passed down through the tongues of my ancestors to preserve my people's history.

Chapter 2
</h3>
<p class="shrunk">
<b><sup>1</sup></b> After the settling of the Chukoti people near the river called Kali a young man known as Kensil during the course of the night had a vision from which Kol and his son the exalted one appeared before him.
  <br/>
<b><sup>2</sup></b> And it came to pass that as Kensil slept Kol revealed unto him the creation of his new church in whom one god, the almighty Kol, shall be worshiped.
  <br/>
<b><sup>3</sup></b> Kol then revealed unto Kensil the sins and transgressions of his people and the ways in which he must preach to the people of Chukoti to turn their hearts to Kol.
  <br/>
<b><sup>4</sup></b> And soon after Kensil received all of this newfound wisdom he brought himself before his people and began to preach.
  <br/>
<b><sup>5</sup></b> And it came to pass that as he preached before the congregation some people joined Kensil who later joined the followers.
  <br/>
<b><sup>6</sup></b> Nevertheless there were some who did not believe and so persecuted Kensil and they who did so were struck by a holy which caused their eyes to be shut and their mouths to be closed.
  <br/>
<b><sup>7</sup></b> Many people then, saw that that which Kensil preacheth was true and so joined him.
  <br/>
<b><sup>8</sup></b> And it came to pass that Kensil appointed twelve leaders of the church whom he called the followers.
  <br/>
<b><sup>9</sup></b> This was how Kensil had heard from Kol and soon after that Kensil called all twelve to preach forth above all people.
  <br/>
<b><sup>10</sup></b> On the morning of the fourth day after Kensil began to preach he arose to a great blackness which encompassed the whole of his vision.
  <br/>
<b><sup>11</sup></b> And soon after, he heard a voice and he knew it was from the one who opposed Kol.
  <br/>
<b><sup>12</sup></b> And Kensil knew it was bad and so while encompassed in darkness Kensil prayed to Kol.
  <br/>
<b><sup>13</sup></b> And it came to pass that after he concluded his prayer there was a great light.
  <br/>
<b><sup>14</sup></b> And Kensil knew that the light was Kol and was exceedingly joyful. 
  <br/>
<b><sup>15</sup></b> And Kol spake unto Kensil once more saying "O Kensil my son, I give thee warning to listen not to the voice of my oppressor for it is he that bringeth death and draineth all my good from this world. 
  <br/>
<b><sup>16</sup></b> And Kensil understood what Kol spake unto him and so obeyed
  <br/>

Chapter 3
</h3>
<p class="shrunk">
  <b><sup>1</sup></b> It came to pass that after two years had passed Kensil fell exceedingly ill and was bedridden. 
  <br/>
   <b><sup>2</sup></b> And it came to pass that Kensil spake unto Kol in prayer and asked of him two things. 
  <br/>
   <b><sup>3</sup></b> Kensil first sought the reason for his illness for which Kol did not respond, then he asked whom shall he appoint as successor, to this Kol did respond.
  <br/>
   <b><sup>4</sup></b> And Kol spoke unto Kensil saying, "Thou shalt appoint Khor to be thy successor."
  <br/>
   <b><sup>5</sup></b> And Kensil looked upon Khor and saw that he was good.
  <br/>
   <b><sup>6</sup></b> Kensil then appointed Mekail to the twelve followers.
  <br/>
   <b><sup>7</sup></b> It came to pass that Kensil who suffereth much due to his illness became exceedingly weak and after but 5 months he was taken by his illness.
  <br/>
   <b><sup>8</sup></b> And thus the will of Kol was fulfilled.[a] 
  <br/>
   <b><sup>9</sup></b> And it was shown that the wisdom of Khor was exceedingly righteous and rich in wisdom.
  <br/>
   <b><sup>10</sup></b> Nevertheless soon into Khors ministry he saw a woman who was exceedingly beautiful and who captivated him.
  <br/>
   <b><sup>11</sup></b> And soon it came to pass that Khor looked into the woman and found her house and went to converse with her.
  <br/>
   <b><sup>12</sup></b> And Khor, after meeting with the woman, learned of her husband and so sought to slit his throat.
  <br/>
   <b><sup>13</sup></b> But nevertheless soon before attempting the life of the woman's husband he was overcome with a great power which was commanding of great respect.
  <br/>
   <b><sup>14</sup></b> As soon as the power set upon Khor he knew that which he had planned was sinful and against Kol and he sought to repent.
  <br/>
   <b><sup>15</sup></b> Kol after a little time forgave Khor through his grace and mercy and sought him to go and preach to the towns of Likta and Hockta which neighbored each other.
  <br/>
   <b><sup>16</sup></b> And it came to pass as Khor went and preached the people's hearts were opened and they joined Khor.
  <br/>
    <b><sup>17</sup></b> And it was shown that Khor became in good favor with Kol.

Chapter 4
</h3>
<p class="shrunk">
<b><sup>1</sup></b> On the evening of the seventh month Khor fell and was overcome with the voice of Kol.
  <br/>
  <b><sup>2</sup></b> And Kol saith unto Khor, "It is by thy hand of whom I am calling that thou shalt be a scribe all of these laws which I shalt give to thee and thy people."
  <br/>
  <b><sup>3</sup></b> Thou shalt not steal nor pillage from another.
  <br/>
  <b><sup>4</sup></b> Thou must have but one god of whom thou shalt worship.
  <br/>
  <b><sup>5</sup></b> Thou shalt not lust after another. 
  <br/>
  <b><sup>6</sup></b> Thou shalt be charitable to the poor.
  <br/>
  <b><sup>7</sup></b> Thy tongue shalt not speak death as it is by me in which you hold life. 
  <br/>
  <b><sup>8</sup></b> And it came to pass that once Khor had heard these words he went into his shop and carved out an obelisk for which it would stand for many long years.
  <br/>
  <b><sup>9</sup></b> And Khor knew that which he engraved was of Kol and so added a footnote.
  <br/>
  <b><sup>10</sup></b> "Thou who reads this text shalt not add to these words lest ye be against Kol and cast out."
  <br/>
  <b><sup>11</sup></b> These were the laws which Khor received through a cloud that had a fiery image that Khor knew was Kol.

Chapter 5
</h3>
<p class="shrunk">
<b><sup>1</sup></b> And it came to pass that Kerek [a] saw the unrighteousness of his people and was very distraught. 
  <br/>
  <b><sup>2</sup></b> And so Kerek went to the center of the settlement and began to preach of the misdeeds of the people.
  <br/>
  <b><sup>3</sup></b> "Listen forth all Chukoti, thou hast fallen away from Kol and thy preacheth in the churches towards other gods" 
  <br/>
  <b><sup>4</sup></b> "Was it not said by thy prophet, Thou must worship but one god who is Kol?"[a]
  <br/>
  <b><sup>5</sup></b> And it came to pass that before Kerek went forth unto the village Avath went unto the tribe leaders and foretold them of his father's plans and when the leaders heard this their hearts were exceedingly unjust and they sent forth two men to capture Kerek.
  <br/>
  <b><sup>6</sup></b> The men arrived and soon heard Kerek's words but their hearts were hardened and they went forth into the crowd and took hold of Kerek.
  <br/>
  <b><sup>7</sup></b> And Kerek was placed in front of the tribal leaders and thus said, 
  <br/>
  <b><sup>8</sup></b> "Why doth thou cast me out for I speak of the one who is all-powerful who is The Lord of all lords, Kol?"
  <br/>
  <b><sup>9</sup></b> "It is by him in which you hold your positions through your first who was Kensil,"[a]
  <br/>
  <b><sup>10</sup></b> "I have seen that thou have turned thine heads from Kol and have worshipped idols in his place" 
  <br/>
  <b><sup>11</sup></b> "It has been shown many times that thine hearts are turned away [a] from those who speak of Kol and you reject the prophets in whom Kol has sent to you."
  <br/>
  <b><sup>12</sup></b> And when the leaders had heard these words they were angry and cold and they brought forth their guards and sent Kerek back to the center in which he had preached. 
  <br/>
  <b><sup>13</sup></b> And behold the crowd in which Kerek had brought forth remained and stood back as Kerek was brought forth.
  <br/>
  <b><sup>14</sup></b> And it was that the tribe leader had commanded that Kerek was to be killed. 
  <br/>
  <b><sup>15</sup></b> And the guards released Kerek and impaled him with a spear made from flint.
