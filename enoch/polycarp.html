    <button onclick="underline(this);"><sup><b>1</b></sup> I have greatly rejoiced with you in our Lord Jesus Christ, because ye 
    have followed the example of true love [as displayed by God], and have 
    accompanied, as became you, those who were bound in chains, the fitting 
    ornaments of saints, and which are indeed the diadems of the true elect of 
    God and our Lord;<br/></button>
    <button onclick="underline(this);"><sup><b>2</b></sup> and because the strong root of your faith, spoken of in days long gone 
    by, endures even until now, and brings forth fruit to our Lord Jesus Christ, 
    who for our sins suffered even unto death, [but] “whom God raised from the 
    dead, having loosed the bands of the grave.”<br/></button>
    <button onclick="underline(this);"><sup><b>3</b></sup> In whom, though now ye see Him not, ye believe, and believing, 
    rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory;" into which joy many desire
    to enter, knowing that “by grace ye are saved, not of works,” but by the will 
    of God through Jesus Christ.<br/></button>
</p>
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p>
    <button onclick="underline(this);"><sup><b>1</b></sup> “Wherefore, girding up your loins,” “serve the Lord in fear” and truth, 
    as those who have forsaken the vain, empty talk and error of the multitude, 
    and “believed in Him who raised up our Lord Jesus Christ from the dead, 
    and gave Him glory,” and a throne at His right hand. To Him all things” in 
    heaven and on earth are subject. Him every spirit serves. He comes as the 
    Judge of the living and the dead. His blood will God require of those who 
    do not believe in Him.<br/></button>
    <button onclick="underline(this);"><sup><b>2</b></sup> But He who raised Him up from the dead will raise up us also, if we do 
    His will, and walk in His commandments, and love what He loved, keeping 
    ourselves from all unrighteousness, covetousness, love of money, evil 
    speaking, false witness; “not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing,” or 
    blow for blow, or cursing for cursing,<br/></button>
    <button onclick="underline(this);"><sup><b>3</b></sup> but being mindful of what the Lord said in His teaching: “Judge not, 
    that ye be not judged; forgive, and it shall be forgiven unto you; be merciful, 
    that ye may obtain mercy; with what measure ye measure out, it shall be 
    measured to you again; and once more, “Blessed are the poor, and those that 
    are persecuted for righteousness’ sake, for theirs is the kingdom of God.”<br/></button>
</p>
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p>
    <button onclick="underline(this);"><sup><b>1</b></sup> These things, brethren, I write to you concerning righteousness, not 
    because I take anything upon myself, but because ye have invited me to do 
    so.<br/></button>
    <button onclick="underline(this);"><sup><b>2</b></sup> For neither I, nor any other such one, can come up to the wisdom of the 
    blessed and glorified Paul. He, when among you, accurately and steadfastly 
    taught the word of truth in the presence of those who were then alive. And 
    when absent from you, he wrote you letters, which, if you carefully study, 
    you will find to be the means of building you up in that faith<br/></button>
    <button onclick="underline(this);"><sup><b>3</b></sup> which has been given you, and which, being followed by hope, and 
    preceeded by love towards God, and Christ, and our neighbor, “is the 
    mother of us all.” For if any one be inwardly possessed of these graces, he 
    hath fulfilled the command of righteousness, since he that hath love is far 
    from all sin.<br/></button>
</p>
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p>
    <button onclick="underline(this);"><sup><b>1</b></sup> “But the love of money is the root of all evils.” Knowing, therefore, 
    that “as we brought nothing into the world, so we can carry nothing out,” 
    let us arm ourselves with the armor of righteousness; and let us teach, first 
    of all, ourselves to walk in the commandments of the Lord.<br/></button>
    <button onclick="underline(this);"><sup><b>2</b></sup> Next, [teach] your wives [to walk] in the faith given to them, and in 
    love and purity tenderly loving their own husbands in all truth, and loving 
    all [others] equally in all chastity; and to train up their children in the 
    knowledge and fear of God.<br/></button>
   <button onclick="underline(this);"> <sup><b>3</b></sup> ³Teach the widows to be discreet as respects the faith of the Lord, 
    praying continually for all, being far from all slandering, evil-speaking, 
    false-witnessing, love of money, and every kind of evil; knowing that they 
    are the altars of God, that He clearly perceives all things, and that nothing is 
    hidden from Him, neither reasonings, nor reflections, nor any one of the 
    secret things of the heart.<br/></button>
</p>
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p>
    <button onclick="underline(this);"><sup><b>1</b></sup> Knowing, then, that “God is not mocked,” we ought to walk worthy of 
    His commandment and glory.<br/></button>
    <button onclick="underline(this);"><sup><b>2</b></sup> In like manner should the deacons be blameless before the face of His 
    righteousness, as being the servants of God and Christ, and not of men. 
    They must not be slanderers, two-faced, or lovers of money, but temperate 
    in all things, compassionate, industrious, walking according to the truth of 
    the Lord, who was the servant of all. If we please Him in this present world, 
    we shall receive also the future world, according as He has promised to us 
    that He will raise us again from the dead, and that if we live worthily of Him, 
    “we shall also reign together with Him,” provided only we believe.<br/></button>
    <button onclick="underline(this);"><sup><b>3</b></sup> In like manner, let the young men also be blameless in all things, being 
    especially careful to preserve purity, and keeping themselves in, as with a 
    bridle, from every kind of evil. For it is well that they should be cut off from 
    the lusts that are in the world, since “every lust warreth against the spirit; 
    “ and “neither fornicators, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with 
    mankind, shall inherit the kingdom of God,” nor those who do things 
    inconsistent and unbecoming. Wherefore, it is needful to abstain from all 
    these things, being subject to the presbyters and deacons, as unto God and 
    Christ. The virgins also must walk in a blameless and pure conscience.<br/></button>
</p>
<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p>
    <button onclick="underline(this);"><sup><b>1</b></sup> And let the presbyters be compassionate and merciful to all, bringing 
    back those that wander, visiting all the sick, and not neglecting the widow, 
    the orphan, or the poor, but always “providing for that which is becoming in 
    the sight of God and man; “abstaining from all wrath, respect of persons, 
    and unjust judgment; keeping far off from. all covetousness, not quickly 
    crediting [an evil report] against any one, not severe in judgment, as 
    knowing that we are all under a debt of sin.<br/></button>
    <button onclick="underline(this);"><sup><b>2</b></sup> If then we entreat the Lord to forgive us, we ought also ourselves to 
    forgive; for we are before the eyes of our Lord and God, and “we must all 
    appear at the judgment-seat of Christ, and everyone must give an account of 
    himself.”<br/></button>
    <button onclick="underline(this);"><sup><b>3</b></sup> Let us then serve Him in fear, and with all reverence, even as He 
    Himself has commanded us, and as the apostles who preached the Gospel 
    unto us, and the prophets who proclaimed beforehand the coming of the 
    Lord [have alike taught us]. Let us be zealous in the pursuit of that which is 
    good, keeping ourselves from causes of offence, from false brethren, and 
    from those who in hypocrisy bear the name of the Lord, and draw away vain 
    men into error.<br/></button>
</p>
<h3>Chapter 7</h3>
<p>
    <button onclick="underline(this);"><sup><b>1</b></sup> “For whoever does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh, 
    is antichrist;” and whoever does not confess the testimony of the cross, is of 
    the devil; and whoever perverts the oracles of the Lord to his own lusts, and 
    says that there is neither a resurrection nor a judgment, he is the first-born of 
    Satan.<br/></button>
    <button onclick="underline(this);"><sup><b>2</b></sup> Wherefore, forsaking the vanity of many, and their false doctrines, let 
    us return to the word which has been handed down to us from the beginning; 
    “watching unto prayer,” and persevering in fasting; beseeching in our 
    supplications the all-seeing God to “not lead us into temptation.” As the 
    Lord has said: “The spirit truly is willing, but the flesh is weak.”<br/></button>
</p>
<h3>Chapter 8</h3>
<p>
    <button onclick="underline(this);"><sup><b>1</b></sup> Let us then continually persevere in our hope, and the earnest of our 
    righteousness, which is Jesus Christ, “who bore our sins in His own body on 
    the tree,” “who did no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth,” but 
    endured all things for us, that we might live in Him.<br/></button>
    <button onclick="underline(this);"><sup><b>2</b></sup> Let us then be imitators of His patience; and if we suffer for His 
    name’s sake, let us glorify Him. For He has set us this example in Himself, 
    and we have believed that such is the case.<br/></button>
</p>
<h3>Chapter 9</h3>
<p>
    <button onclick="underline(this);"><sup><b>1</b></sup> I exhort you all, therefore, to yield obedience to the word of 
    righteousness, and to exercise all patience, such as ye have seen [set] before 
    your eyes, not only in the case of the blessed Ignatius, and Zosimus, and 
    Rufus, but also in others among yourselves, and in Paul himself, and the rest 
    of the apostles.<br/></button>
    <button onclick="underline(this);"><sup><b>2</b></sup> [This do] in the assurance that all these have not run in vain, but in 
    faith and righteousness, and that they are [now] in their due place in the 
    presence of the Lord, with whom also they suffered. For they loved not this 
    11
    present world, but Him who died for us, and for our sakes was raised again 
    by God from the dead.<br/></button>
</p>
<h3>Chapter 10</h3>
<p>
    <button onclick="underline(this);"><sup><b>1</b></sup> Stand fast, therefore, in these things, and follow the example of the 
    Lord, being firm and unchangeable in the faith, loving the brotherhood, and 
    being attached to one another, joined together in the truth, exhibiting the 
    meekness of the Lord in your interaction with one another, and despising no 
    one.<br/></button>
    <button onclick="underline(this);"><sup><b>2</b></sup> When you can do good, defer it not, because “alms delivers from 
    death.” Be all of you subject one to another, having your conduct blameless 
    among the Gentiles, that ye may both receive praise for your good works, 
    and the Lord may not be blasphemed through you.<br/></button>
    <button onclick="underline(this);"><sup><b>3</b></sup> But woe to him by whom the name of the Lord is blasphemed! Teach, 
    therefore, sobriety to all, and manifest it also in your own conduct.<br/></button>
</p>
<h3>Chapter 11</h3>
<p>
    <button onclick="underline(this);"><sup><b>1</b></sup> I am greatly grieved for Valens, who was once a presbyter among you, 
    because he so little understands the place that was given him [in the Church]. 
    I exhort you, therefore, that ye abstain from covetousness, and that ye be 
    chaste and truthful. “Abstain from every form of evil.”<br/></button>
    <button onclick="underline(this);"><sup><b>2</b></sup> For if a man cannot govern himself in such matters, how shall he 
    enjoin them on others? If a man does not keep himself from covetousness, 
    he shall be defiled by idolatry, and shall be judged as one of the heathen. 
    But who of us are ignorant of the judgment of the Lord? “Do we not know 
    that the saints shall judge the world?” as Paul teaches.<br/></button>
    <button onclick="underline(this);"><sup><b>3</b></sup> But I have neither seen nor heard of any such thing among you, in the 
    midst of whom the blessed Paul labored, and who are commended in the 
    beginning of his Epistle. For he boasts of you in all those Churches which 
    alone then knew the Lord; but we [of Smyrna] had not yet known Him.<br/></button>
    <button onclick="underline(this);"><sup><b>4</b></sup> I am deeply grieved, therefore, brethren, for him (Valens) and his wife; to 
    whom may the Lord grant true repentance! ⁴ And be ye then moderate in 
    regard to this matter, and “do not count such as enemies,” but call them back 
    as suffering and straying members, that ye may save your whole body. For 
    by so acting ye shall edify yourselves.<br/></button>
</p>
<h3>Chapter 12</h3>
<p>
    <button onclick="underline(this);"><sup><b>1</b></sup> For I trust that ye are well versed in the Sacred Scriptures, and that 
    nothing is hidden from you; but to me this privilege is not yet granted. It is 
    declared then in these Scriptures, “Be ye angry, and sin not,” and, “Let not 
    the sun go down upon your wrath.” Happy is he who remembers this, which 
    I believe to be the case with you.<br/></button>
    <button onclick="underline(this);"><sup><b>2</b></sup> But may the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and Jesus Christ 
    Himself, who is the Son of God, and our everlasting High Priest, build you 
    up in faith and truth, and in all meekness, gentleness, patience, long￾suffering, forbearance, and purity; and may He bestow on you a lot and 
    portion among His saints, and on us with you, and on all who are under 
    heaven, who shall believe in our Lord Jesus Christ, and in His Father, who 
    “raised Him from the dead.<br/></button>
    <button onclick="underline(this);"><sup><b>3</b></sup> Pray for all the saints. Pray also for kings, and potentates, and princes, 
    and for those that persecute and hate you, and for the enemies of the cross, 
    that your fruit may be manifest to all, and that ye may be perfect in Him.<br/></button>
</p>
<h3>Chapter 13</h3>
<p>
    <button onclick="underline(this);"><sup><b>1</b></sup> Both you and Ignatius wrote to me, that if any one went [from this] 
    into Syria, he should carry your letter with him; which request I will attend 
    to if I find a fitting opportunity, either personally, or through some other 
    acting for me, that your desire may be fulfilled.<br/></button>
    <button onclick="underline(this);"><sup><b>2</b></sup> The Epistles of Ignatius written by him to us, and all the rest [of his 
    Epistles] which we have by us, we have sent to you, as you requested. They 
    are subjoined to this Epistle, and by them ye may be greatly profited; for 
    they treat of faith and patience, and all things that tend to edification in our 
    Lord. Any more certain information you may have obtained respecting both 
    Ignatius himself, and those that were with him, have the goodness to make 
    known to us.<br/></button>
</p>
<h3>Chapter 14</h3>
<p>
    <button onclick="underline(this);"><sup><b>1</b></sup> These things I have written to you by Crescens, whom up to the present 
    time I have recommended unto you, and do now recommend. For he has 
    acted blamelessly among us, and I believe also among you. Moreover, ye 
    will hold his sister in esteem when she comes to you. Be ye safe in the Lord 
    Jesus Christ. Grace be with you all. Amen.<br/></button>
