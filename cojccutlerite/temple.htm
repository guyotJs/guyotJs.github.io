    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As members of The Church of Jesus Christ, we look forward to the time when Christ will
    again return to this earth. We are told there is a series of events that must happen
    before the Savior returns.</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most important event was the restoration of the
    Kingdom Authority, in the late 1820's, which had been lost from the earth for about 1400 years. The Lord chose to
    restore the Kingdom Authority through Joseph Smith Jr. Without authority from God,
    nothing can be accomplished. The Church of Jesus Christ, organized April 6, 1830, by
    Joseph Smith Jr, was the only church on earth holding the true authority,
    and even though it was eventually rejected because of their failure to
    adhere to all of God's commandments, it was reorganized using this same
    Kingdom Authority and is, we believe, the&nbsp; church
    that the Lord will return to in the future.</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first revelation given through Joseph Smith Jr. concerning the temple lot was given
    in July, 1831 in Independence, Jackson County, Missouri. (reference section 27, verse 1,
    1846 edition of Doctrine and Covenants).</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Hearken, O ye elders of my church, saith the Lord your God, who have assembled
    yourselves together, according to my commandments, in this land which is the land of
    Missouri, which is the land which I have appointed and consecrated for the gathering of
    the saints: Wherefore this is the land of promise, and the place for the city of Zion. And
    thus saith the Lord your God, if you will receive wisdom here is wisdom. Behold the place
    which is now called Independence, is the center place, and the spot for the temple is
    lying westward upon a lot which is not far from the court house.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here we see that Independence was designated as the center place of Zion, and that this
    is the land that God appointed and consecrated for the gathering of the saints, and he
    described the building spot for the temple to be built in the city of Zion.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On August 1, 1831, Joseph received another revelation pertaining to the temple lot.
    (reference section 18, verse 13, 1846 edition of Doctrine and Covenants).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And let my servant Sidney Rigdon consecrate and dedicate this land, and the spot
    of the temple, unto the Lord.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, in response to this commandment, those instructions were carried out. To
    prove this, I quote excerpts from Joseph&#146;s own words as recorded in the Times and
    Seasons, Volume 5, page 450, and also in the RLDS Church History, Volume 1, pages 205-209.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;On the second day of August, I assisted the Colesville branch of the church to
    lay the first log, for a house, as a foundation for Zion in Kaw Township, twelve miles
    west of Independence. The log was placed and carried by twelve men, in honor of the twelve
    tribes of Israel. At the same time, through prayer, the land of Zion was consecrated and
    dedicated for the gathering of the saints, by Elder Rigdon.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;On the third day of August, the spot for the Temple, a little west of
    Independence, was dedicated in the presence of eight men, among whom were myself, Sidney
    Rigdon, Edward Partridge, W.W. Phelps, Oliver Cowdery, Martin Harris, and Joseph Coe. The
    eighty-seventh Psalm was read, and the scene was solemn and impressive.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In September, 1831, Joseph Smith Jr. received another revelation describing the
    gathering of the Saints to the land of Zion, the building of a temple for Christ to return
    to, and again pointed out the exact spot where that Temple would be built. Quoting from
    Section 4, verses 1 and 2, 1846 edition of Doctrine and Covenants:</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. &quot;A revelation of Jesus Christ unto his servant Joseph Smith, jr. and six
    elders, as they united their hearts and lifted their voices on high; yea, the word of the
    Lord concerning his church, established in the last days for the restoration of his
    people, as he has spoken by the mouth of his prophets, and for the gathering of his saints
    to stand upon mount Zion, which shall be the city New Jerusalem; which city shall be
    built, beginning at the Temple Lot, which is appointed by the finger of the Lord, in the
    western boundaries of the state of Missouri, and dedicated by the hand of Joseph Smith,
    jr. and others, with whom the Lord was well pleased .&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. &quot;Verily, this is the word of the Lord, that the city New Jerusalem shall be
    built by the gathering of the saints, beginning at this place, even the place of the
    temple, which temple shall be reared in this generation; for verily, this generation shall
    not all pass away until an house shall be built unto the Lord, and a cloud shall rest upon
    it, which cloud shall be even the glory of the Lord, which shall fill the house.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We understand that the temple will be built by honest in heart people, who will gather
    to Independence, Missouri from all quarters of the earth. These are those who have
    accepted the true gospel and have become a part of the only church that holds the true
    authority.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe the sacred ground appointed by the finger of the Lord is in Independence,
    Missouri, and is the place where the holy temple will be erected. Section 4 says the
    temple will be &quot;--reared in this generation--&quot;, referring to the generation of
    saints that will be gathering together at that time. And to further quote, &quot;--this
    generation shall not all pass away until an house shall be built unto the Lord and a cloud
    shall rest upon it.&quot; There will be no question as to the validity of the temple, or
    the piece of land that it sets upon, as there will be a cloud resting upon it, put there
    by God, as promised in the revelation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all the events on God&#146;s timetable have been fulfilled, the Lord will return
    again to reign with his people, for a thousand years.</font></font></p>
