    What are they?&nbsp; Who
    wrote them, and when?&nbsp; A surprisingly large number of the restoration believers have
    never heard of them, so naturally are ignorant of what they contain.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These 7
    lectures were delivered by Joseph Smith at the School of the Prophets in Kirtland, Ohio
    about 1833,&nbsp; prior to sending the elders forth to the world on their various
    missions.&nbsp; They were given for the purpose of helping the elders gain a better
    understanding of the doctrine they were to teach unto the world.&nbsp; The committee of
    four formed&nbsp; in September, 1831, to compile the book later known as the
    <a href="dandc.htm"> Doctrine and
    Covenants </a> of the Church of Jesus Christ, during their 4 year stand,&nbsp; agreed to put
    these lectures in the forepart of the book.&nbsp; In the General Assembly of the Church of
    August 1835, all the quorums present voted to accept the book as compiled by the committee
    and using the records of that meeting the following statement:&nbsp; &quot;Elder John
    Smith, taking the lead of the High Council in Kirtland, bore record that the revelations
    in said book were true, and that the lectures were judiciously arranged and compiled, and
    were profitable for doctrine; whereupon the High Council of Kirtland accepted them and
    acknowledged them as the Doctrine and Covenants of their faith, by a unanimous vote&quot;.
    &nbsp; This was followed by unanimous acceptance of the other contents by the Assembly.
    &nbsp; The edition of the 1835 was printed thus;&nbsp; with the Lectures on Faith in the
    front of the book, followed by the revelations given up to that time, and the other
    material in it's place.&nbsp; There the Lectures remained in all subsequent editions of
    the book up to 1897 when one of the larger factions voted to omit them.&nbsp; In 1921
    another large faction followed suit and discontinued printing them in the book. &nbsp;
    Today both factions describe them as being of historical value only.&nbsp; When we read
    and study these lectures we can begin to understand why they were omitted and no longer
    printed.&nbsp; They teach a road that is far too close for anyone but those with the
    Spirit of God and a desire to learn.&nbsp; As Brother (Rupert) Fletcher in his book &quot;<a href="fletbook.htm">Alpheus Cutler and the Church of Jesus Christ</a>&quot;
    &nbsp; page 332 asked, &quot;How much have the Churches gained by taking out the Lectures?
    &nbsp; Has it proven an advantage, and has it brought about a closed unity among the
    members?&quot;&nbsp; This is a very good question;&nbsp; how would you answer it? &nbsp;
    The people who are trying to serve their Lord need all the help they can get to combat the
    power of evil; and do we gain the strength necessary when we toss this help away?&nbsp;
    Lecture (number) 6, especially, contains instruction and statements that any man seeking
    to gain his salvation cannot afford to deny or refuse to accept.&nbsp; It calls upon man
    to lay down his all, his character and reputation, his honor and applause, his good name
    among men, his houses, his lands, his brothers and sisters, his wife and children, and
    even his own life also;&nbsp; counting all things but filth and dross, for the excellency
    of the knowledge of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Now can you begin to understand why these lectures
    are not popular with those having the natural mind of man?&nbsp; And can you not begin to
    realize the seriousness of the cause that the principles taught in these lectures seek to
    build up?&nbsp; We can begin to understand why the original church officials voted they
    were profitable for the doctrine and wanted them included in that book.&nbsp; Man at best
    does a pretty sorry job of serving their God, and with the obstacles placed in their path
    by the powers of evil, only by the acceptance of the truths contained in these lectures
    can this be thwarted.&nbsp; What spirit would you say actuated those leaders in these two
    factions when they voted the lectures were no longer of value as doctrine and omitted them
    from that book?&nbsp; Who was right, the early officers who voted they should be in there
    and were profitable for doctrine, or those who voted later that they were not?&nbsp; As
    Brother Fletcher asked, &quot; did they profit from it?&quot; &nbsp; To my way of
    thinking, they did their members a great disservice by depriving all those following their
    leadership, of the truths contained in those lectures.&nbsp; Very few people, belonging to
    these factions of the present generation, have even hear of the lectures, and of those who
    have, very few are acquainted with their contents, and yet the early officers of the
    Church counted them of great value.&nbsp; Would you say that was advancement?</font></p>
