    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preface:
    &nbsp; Due to frequent inquiries from different ones concerning the doctrine and beliefs
    of <em>The Church of Jesus Christ</em>,&nbsp; I will attempt to outline, in as brief a
    manner as possible, a rough outline of our beliefs and doctrines. (More detailed articles
    appear on other pages of this website.)</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe that
    for a period of some 1400 years after the Saviour's death the gospel and the authority was
    off the earth and men wandered without it's benefit.&nbsp; We believe that a latter day
    prophet was raised up in the person of Joseph Smith Jr. to be the agent of God in
    restoring again the same gospel and authority that existed on the earth in former times;
    that the spirit from on high inspired this young man and gave him the keys and authority
    to again set up &quot;The Church of Jesus Christ&quot; as recorded in history. &nbsp; By
    angelic ordination this young man, along with others, were given the rights and authority
    of the Holy Priesthood or Kingdom Authority and by these authorities organized &quot;The
    Church of Jesus Christ&quot; on April 6, 1830, at Fayette, New York.&nbsp; This church
    enjoyed a rapid growth, but was also subjected to much persecution and many trials
    throughout a 14 year period which ended in the prophet and his brother being killed by a
    mob at Carthage, Illinois.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior to
    the prophet's death they were instructed to build a building or temple at Nauvoo,
    Illinois.&nbsp; They were told enough had been given or would be given to complete it in
    an appointed time, and if they failed to do so in that time, they would be rejected as a
    &quot;church with their dead&quot;.&nbsp; See section 107, verse 11a, RLDS&nbsp; book of
    Doctrine and Covenants.&nbsp; This building was never completed or accepted, consequently
    the church was rejected and ceased to be a church.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The body of
    the former church was driven out of Nauvoo and the main part fled westward across Iowa,
    reaching a place in Nebraska, just north of present day Omaha.&nbsp; There, a general
    break-up of the group occurred.&nbsp; Those following Brigham Young journeyed west to
    Utah, while others went their various ways.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alpheus
    Cutler, a member of this earlier Kingdom Order, was sent on a mission to the Indians, in
    Kansas.&nbsp; Completing this and not wishing to return to Winter Quarters, Cutler settled
    in southwestern Iowa at a place they called Manti.&nbsp; Here they established a colony
    consisting of farms, stores, and shops of various kinds. &nbsp; Cutler, being one of the
    &quot;Order of Seven&quot; of the original Kingdom Order (see section 83, verse 1a, RLDS
    book of Doctrine and Covenants) and being ordained under the hands of Joseph Smith Jr. to
    the same rights to lead the church that the Prophet enjoyed; after receiving a sign,
    reorganized The Church of Jesus Christ on September 19, 1853, at Manti, Iowa.&nbsp; Of all
    the groups coming out of the break-up at Winter Quarters, Cutler was the only one who came
    out teaching the same principles and doctrine that the original church espoused.&nbsp; He
    stated that he took Joseph Smith the Prophet, the Bible, the Book of Mormon, the book of
    Doctrine and Covenants, and the Constitution of these United States as the platform to
    build the church upon.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of his
    main tenets was the <a href="common.htm">Order of Enoch</a>, or all things common. &nbsp;
    This order has always been present whenever a great outpouring of the spirit occurred,
    such as at the days of Pentecost and during the Book of Mormon days when they lived to
    it's principles for 200 years.&nbsp; See Book of Mormon 3rd Nephi, chapter 12, verse 11
    and 4th Nephi, chapter 1, verse 4.&nbsp; This requires from man, a sacrifice of their all
    unto the Lord, a sacrifice that is not at all popular with the natural mind of man.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alpheus
    Cutler died August 10, 1864, and was succeeded in office by Chauncey Whiting. &nbsp;&nbsp;
    Shortly after Cutler's death the church moved to Minnesota where they established a
    thriving community at Clitherall or Old Town, as it is now known. &nbsp; During this next
    10 year period they were visited by missionaries of a different restoration group who
    offered an easier way of life and lead off those who were weak in the faith, and
    many young members.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chauncy
    Whiting passed away in 1902 and was&nbsp; followed by his son, Isaac, in church
    leadership.&nbsp; Isaac continued in his office until his death in 1922, at which time
    Emery Fletcher assumed the role of President.&nbsp; About 1912, the Order of Enoch, having
    been discontinued, for a time, due to the reluctance of some in turning in the homesteads
    they had proved out upon,&nbsp; it was decided to again set up the Order as originally
    instituted, and it has been maintained to the present day.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1928 a
    movement was made for the church to return to Zion.&nbsp; A committee was sent to
    Independence, Missouri.&nbsp; They purchased property and built a church building at 807
    South Cottage Ave, which is the present headquarters of the church.&nbsp; Other families
    eventually followed until at present there is only one member residing in Minnesota.
    &nbsp; Emery Fletcher passed away in&nbsp; 1953 and was followed in office by Erle Whiting
    who continued, until his death in 1958, at which time Rupert Fletcher succeeded him.
    &nbsp; </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before his
    death in 1974, Brother Fletcher wrote a book titled <em><a href="fletbook.htm">Alpheus
    Cutler and The Church of Jesus Christ.</a>&nbsp; </em>This book is recommended reading to
    anyone desiring to know the beliefs and doctrine of The Church of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; It
    also contains an interesting historical account of the church from Cutler's day to the
    present time, written by Mrs. Fletcher (Daisy Whiting Fletcher).</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps
    where we differ most from the other groups of the Restoration movement, is that we believe
    that a man is called to come with his all, with a broken heart and contrite spirit. &nbsp;
    He should offer himself up for baptism and at the water's edge make a covenant with his
    Lord to keep all the commandments that He has given and will give, as long as he shall
    live. After immersion and a washing away of his sin, he will continue in his covenant to
    his God and grow in knowledge and understanding, through a constant search of the Holy
    Scriptures and prayer, that he might have the gift of the Holy Spirit to guide him in his
    efforts.&nbsp; By practicing the Order of Enoch, he places himself on an equal with his
    brothers and they grow together and sanctify themselves before their God.&nbsp; This is a
    close road and few there be who will be willing to make the required sacrifices.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe
    that a man must be fully converted, believing this course is necessary, before he can be
    an acceptable candidate for baptism.&nbsp; Unless a man is fully converted to these
    principles, he will be unable to meet the requirements and fail in his efforts.&nbsp; We
    do not seek members for the sake of membership only, but true converts who are willing to
    take upon themselves a whole new way of life, and who will work with their might, mind and
    strength for the up building of their church.&nbsp; We have been told our membership or
    entrance requirements are too high and in order to get new members we must lower them.
    &nbsp; As stated before, we seek only true converts and we want each one to make his own
    decision, as we do not believe in the &quot;hard sell&quot;.&nbsp; We welcome anyone who
    is truly seeking his salvation and we know that someday a people will be inspired&nbsp; to
    meet these requirements and join in building this Zion prophesied of,&nbsp; by the Holy
    prophets in days gone by.&nbsp; This great work will only be done by people living to
    those laws and commandments in their entirety, working together in love and union under
    His true authority and thus will have the promise of the Lord that He will go before them
    and be their rearward.</font></p>
