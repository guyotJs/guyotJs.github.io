    What is
    meant by the Trinity?</font><font face="Signet Roundhand" size="6">&nbsp; </font><font
    face="Times New Roman">Is there more than one God, or is</font></font><font
    face="Times New Roman" size="4"> the Father and the Son,
    the one and the same being?&nbsp; To me the theory that there is only one God is absurd.
    &nbsp; How could there be a son without a father?&nbsp; The prophets all testify of the
    Father and the Son.&nbsp; We are given to understand that there is more than one God in
    the Universe, by those who have been permitted to see within the vail.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are a
    few established facts set forth in the scriptures on which we can base our belief. &nbsp;
    First of all we are given to understand that God the Father is the ultimate of
    perfection,&nbsp; that He is unchangeable and also immortal.&nbsp; Now when we think of
    the Father and the Son we must think of an immortal Father and the birth of a mortal Son,
    a son who was born of the virgin Mary after she had conceived of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; Let
    us not forget this contrast, the mortal son and the immortal Father for herein lies a very
    important factor in our judging of the matter.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could the
    Father disengage His spirit from an immortal body and come to earth and inhabit a mortal
    body, born of the flesh?&nbsp; If so would He not become mortal to suffer pain in the
    flesh?&nbsp; Christ did.&nbsp; Would not the Father lower Himself to the level of man in
    the flesh?&nbsp; We are told by the words of the prophets that when Jesus was born he was
    like other children until he was around twelve years of age.&nbsp; Now if Jesus was the
    Father over the universe and came to earth and took upon Himself flesh, what happened to
    the immortal body He had laid aside when He made the change?&nbsp; This would make the
    Father a changeable. God</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another
    thing to remember is, that when Jesus was resurrected He retained the same&nbsp; body
    which bore the wounds of His crucifixion,&nbsp; the body of which Mary had given birth,
    that mortal body which had undergone the change wrought by the resurrection.&nbsp; Thomas
    would not believe He was the Christ until he had thrust his hands into the wounds He had
    received on the cross.&nbsp; This proves that Jesus Christ was not the Father over the
    universe, but the Son whom the Father had sent to perform the work which God had appointed
    Him to do.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact
    that Jesus Christ received and retained a body of his own shows that he was not the Father
    who had laid aside His immortal body to come here and become mortal, for He did not go
    back into eternity and pick up the other body.&nbsp; If it had been the Father who came
    here posing as the Christ and grew up as a little child, who would have looked after the
    affairs of the Universe while He was in that innocent and child-like state?&nbsp; I am
    constrained to believe there is a Universal God who has the oversight of all things both
    in heaven and on earth, and that Jesus Christ the Son is the God over this earth, working
    under the supervision of the Father.&nbsp; Both are guided by the same Holy Sprit by which
    they are able to perform all their matchless acts and deeds in perfect unison. This makes
    them one in purpose, but separate in body.&nbsp; This they are one the Father and the Son.
