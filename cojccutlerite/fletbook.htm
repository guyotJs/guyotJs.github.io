    Published in1974</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp; From time to time individuals have requested historical data
    concerning Alpheus Cutler and the church he represented.&nbsp; Many times the inquiries
    have gone unanswered because such information seemed not to be available. &nbsp;&nbsp;
    Considerable research in recent years, however, has been successful to some degree, and
    this book has been prepared in the hope that it may prove helpful.</font></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An effort has been
    made to arrange in chronological order the known facts about Mr. Cutler, his family,
    places where he resided, and his affiliation with the Church of Jesus Christ and the
    restored gospel.&nbsp; Often names, dates, and places are missing that would add much to
    the value of the story.&nbsp; Hopefully some of these facts may yet be found through
    continued search.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This book is
    dedicated to the young people of the church who are descendants of these early families,
    that they may more fully appreciate the legacy that is theirs.&nbsp; The men and women who
    preserved the authority and the church for our generations are now gone, but their faith,
    diligence, and prayers have made possible the religious heritage we enjoy today.&nbsp; Let
    us cherish the sacred gift and strive to so conduct our lives that its name may be honored
    and revered.<br>

    <p align="center"><font face="Rockwell" size="4">About The Authors</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. and
    Mrs. Rupert J. Fletcher collaborated in writing an interesting book about one of the lesser
    known churches of the Restoration.&nbsp; The historical sketch written by Mrs. Fletcher
    (Daisy Whiting Fletcher), and the articles on doctrinal beliefs by Mr. Fletcher,
    who at the time was president of the church, are
    combined to give the reader an account of The Church of Jesus Christ, its background, its
    teachings, and pattern for future development.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    Fletchers are both descended from early-day believers in the restored gospel.&nbsp; They
    were born in Clitherall, Minnesota, and moved to Independence, Missouri, in 1928 and 1929,
    with their parents.&nbsp; They were married in 1930 and resided in Independence until Mr.
    Fletchers death in 1974 and Mrs. Fletchers death in 1975.&nbsp; </font></p>
