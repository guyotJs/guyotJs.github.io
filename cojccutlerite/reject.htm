    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rejection of the
    Church is a subject that is neither accepted nor understood by the majority of people in
    the restoration movement. It came about as a result of the failure of the Church
    membership to keep a <u>direct commandment</u> given to them from God concerning the
    building of the Nauvoo Temple.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reference: Book of Doctrine &amp; Covenants;
    1844-1846 editions, section 103, verses 10 &amp; 11; RLDS edition, section 107, verses 10
    &amp; 11; UTAH edition, section 124, verses 25 thru 36.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to quote 3
    sentences from the above references:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&quot;But <u>I command you</u>, all ye my Saints,
    to build a house unto me; and I grant unto you a sufficient time to build a house unto me,
    and during this time your baptisms shall be acceptable unto me.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But behold, at the end
    of this appointment, your baptisms for your dead shall not be acceptable unto me; and if
    you do not these things at the end of the appointment, ye shall be rejected as a church
    with your dead, saith the Lord your God.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For verily I say unto
    you, that after you have had sufficient time to build a house to me, wherein the ordinance
    of baptizing for the dead belongeth, and for which the same was instituted from before the
    foundation of the world, your baptisms for your dead can not be acceptable unto me; for
    therein are the keys of the holy priesthood ordained, that you may receive honor and
    glory.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the above, we see
    that God&#146;s people were given a direct commandment to build this temple, and the
    consequences were very plainly spelled out if they did not accomplish this in the
    appointed time, namely being &quot;rejected as a church with their dead&quot;. Now we know
    from historical accounts that, not only was the temple never completed, but it was allowed
    to be desecrated and destroyed, and the Saint&#146;s homes were ransacked and
    they were driven out&#133;all because of their failure to keep his commandment. They were
    not willing to impart of their substance what was required of them, so they were forced to
    suffer the consequences. It is true they got far enough along with the temple to perform
    some of the ordinances inside, but the fact remains that it was never completely finished.
    Therefore the Church was, of necessity, rejected just as he had promised, as God is
    unchangeable and cannot lie.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the reader might ask
    &quot;How was this possible when God had told them that his &quot;Kingdom&quot; would
    never again leave the earth&quot;? Let us examine this statement as set forth in section
    85 (section 87 in RLDS, and section 90 in UTAH editions) of the Doctrine &amp; Covenants.
    Verse 1 says &quot;Therefore art thou blessed from henceforth that bear the keys of the
    kingdom given unto you; which kingdom is coming forth for the last time.&quot; Verse 2
    says &quot;Verily I say unto you, the keys of this kingdom shall never be taken from you,
    while thou art in this world, neither in the world to come; nevertheless, through you
    shall the oracles be given to another; yea, even unto the Church.&quot; And verse 5 says
    &quot;And this shall be your business and mission in all your lives to preside in council
    and set in order all the affairs of this Church and Kingdom.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the above we begin
    to understand the distinction made between the &quot;Church&quot; and the
    &quot;Kingdom&quot;. Even though the Church was rejected, the Kingdom authority remained
    as was promised, never again to leave the earth. Alpheus Cutler was the only leader coming
    out of the original Church that understood this concept in it&#146;s entirety, and kept it
    intact.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now let us analyze what
    we have learned so far; We know that God cannot lie and that he keeps <u>all</u> of his
    promises. We know the temple was never completed, so then the Church
    must have been rejected just as he promised it would be. This being the case, then the
    only way this could happen is through the way he provided, with the Church and Kingdom
    being separate entities. Only 3 groups accepted the fact that the Church had been rejected
    and realized the need for a reorganization. Of these 3, only the one reorganized by Cutler
    still adheres to all of the original doctrines that were restored in their purity by
    Joseph Smith, with no additions or deletions.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a more in-depth
    treatise on this subject, you may read section 6 titled &quot;The Scattered Children Of
    Zion&quot; in the book &quot;<a href="fletbook.htm">Alpheus Cutler and the Church of Jesus
    Christ&quot; </a>by Rupert J. Fletcher &amp; Daisy (Whiting) Fletcher. Chapters 7 (Alpheus
    Cutler And Zenos Gurley Letters) and 8 (Alpheus Cutler On Reorganization) in this section
    are especially relevant and helpful.</font></p>
