    article was written for the express purpose of supplying information to those who, at
    various times, may request information on certain beliefs and doctrine of our
    church.&nbsp; In the interest of brevity scriptural quotations will be held to a minimum
    and the article itself as brief as possible and still convey the information
    requested.&nbsp; Further information concerning specific subjects can be furnished from
    various sources already written.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Rockwell" size="4">The Kingdom Authority-The Order of Seven</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This
    subject is relatively unknown to most of the restoration believers, but it is a subject of
    such prime importance that a knowledge of it should be acquired by all believers in this
    great latter day work.&nbsp; Were it not for the &quot;Order of Seven or Kingdom
    Authority&quot; the church, following it's rejection at Nauvoo, Illinois would have
    disappeared from the earth and the gospel with it's attendant authority would have been
    lost to man.&nbsp; Through the angelic ordinations by the seven heavenly messengers sent
    to convey this authority to Joseph Smith and his followers, people on the earth were again
    empowered or authorized of God to set up His church on the earth.&nbsp; It was prophesied
    then that it was restored for the last time and would never again leave the earth until
    all things promised were accomplished.&nbsp; Upon rejection of the church at the failure
    to build the Nauvoo Temple in the appointed time the church ceased to exist but the
    kingdom order or authority of the Holy Priesthood's continued with those holding these
    ordinations, and only through this kingdom order could the church have been reorganized
    and setup; the same authority by which it was established originally.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This will
    seem a strange doctrine to many of the restoration believers.&nbsp; Alpheus Cutler was
    number seven in that order at the time of the churches reorganization in 1853.&nbsp; Prior
    to that time he had been ordained by the Prophet Joseph Smith to all the powers and
    authority necessary to carry forward the work that the Prophet had been commissioned to do
    but was unable to complete because of his death.&nbsp; This was borne out by the testimony
    of several who were present at that time.&nbsp; Mother (Lois) Cutler testified she was
    present when the above mentioned ordination was given and that she saw the Prophet lay his
    hands upon Cutler's head and ordain him to all the rights, keys, powers, privileges, and
    blessings belonging to that condition and whose right to act as prophet, seer, and
    revelator was to be in force upon the whole world from that very hour, thus fulfilling the
    law of succession as given by the Lord to the Prophet Joseph and the church, RLDS Section
    43, paragraph 2.&nbsp; Several others of the <a href="history.htm">Manti</a> group also
    testified that they were in attendance at the general conference in Nauvoo, Illinois when
    Joseph, in his address to the congregation informed them he had men prepared who could
    carry on the work as well as he, should he be taken;&nbsp; that he then placed his hand
    upon Alpheus Cutler and said &quot;And here is the man who will do it&quot;.&nbsp; Marcus
    Shaw alludes to this when he speaks of the Lord setting up His kingdom in 1843, (Our
    Church record book number 2, section 1, page 239).&nbsp; No record has been found as to
    the identity of the quorum of seven with the exception of the last two;&nbsp; Cutler
    stated that Uncle John Smith was number six and he was number seven at this time.&nbsp;
    Cutler waited until the sign was given he had been forewarned would come before setting up
    the church.&nbsp; The new church required all former members to be re-baptized for it was
    a re-organization rather than a continuation.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In section
    83, RLDS Doctrine and Covenants it speaks of Joseph Smith and six elders who united their
    hearts and lifted their voices on high and were given instructions concerning the church
    and how to conduct it's affairs.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Section
    49, RLDS book of Doctrine and Covenants, paragraph 2c, it speaks of &quot;holy men that ye
    know not of&quot;,&nbsp; so evidently there was a quorum or group that not everyone was
    aware of.&nbsp; The Lord, being a God of order would surely not have deemed it necessary
    to send His holy angels to earth to convey unto men this authority to establish a church
    in 1830 unless this same authority was necessary and to be present at the following
    reorganization.&nbsp; It is only by the authority of those priesthoods that man can
    represent God here on earth and as spoken of in Section 84, RLDS book of Doctrine and
    Covenants, &quot;it must needs remain, through you and your lineage, until the restoration
    of all things spoken by the mouths of all the holy prophets since the world began, and
    through this Priesthood, a savior unto my people Israel&quot;.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More
    details concerning this subject can be acquired by searching the revelations in the book
    of Doctrine and Covenants, as well as the Bible and the Book of Mormon; also by referring
    to the book, &quot;<a href="fletbook.htm">Alpheus Cutler and The Church of Jesus Christ</a>&quot;,
    written by Brother Rupert Fletcher.&nbsp; Brother Fletcher wrote in considerable detail on
    this and other subjects and his book is highly recommended reading for anyone desirous of
    learning the beliefs and doctrine of The Church of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;
