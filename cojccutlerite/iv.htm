    </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to
    translating the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith Jr. corrected many errors contained in the
    King James translation of the Bible. The corrected scripture is known as the Inspired Version of
    the Bible.&nbsp; This version of the Holy Scriptures, containing the old and the new
    testaments, was revised through inspiration by Joseph Smith Jr., beginning
    June 1830 and was finished July 2, 1833.&nbsp; The manuscripts, at his death in
    1844, were left in the hands of his widow, Emma,&nbsp; where they remained until the
    Spring of 1866, when they were delivered to a committee appointed to procure them for
    publication.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is
    declared in the Book of Mormon, 1st Book of Nephi, Chapter 3, verses 168-172, &quot;For
    behold, they have taken away from the gospel of the lamb many parts which are plain and
    most precious, and also many covenants of the Lord have they taken away and all this have
    they done that they might pervert the right ways of the Lord;&nbsp; that they might blind
    the eyes and harden the hearts of the children of men:&nbsp; wherefore, thou seest that
    after the book hath gone forth through the hands of the great and abominable
    church that
    there are many plain and precious things taken away from the book, which is the book of the
    Lamb of God, and after these plain and precious things were taken away, it goeth forth
    unto all the nations of the Gentiles&quot;.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It states
    in the book of Doctrine and Covenants, Section 42, verse 15, &quot;Thou shalt ask, and my
    scriptures shall be given as I have appointed, and they shall be preserved in safety; and
    it is expedient that thou shouldst hold thy peace concerning them, and not teach them
    until thou hast received them in full.&nbsp; And I give unto you a commandment, that then
    ye shall teach them unto all men; for they shall be taught unto all nations, kindreds,
    tongues, and people.&quot;</font> </p>
